# This example file demonstrates match statements

let x = 5 in return (x + 9) ;;

# really just parses as

match 5 with 
  | x -> return (x + 9) ;;

# we also desugar if statements to match statements to 

if 5 < 4 then return 4 else return 5 ;; 

match 5 < 4 with
  | true -> return 4
  | false -> return 5 ;;

# but we also don't do exahustiveness checking currently, so 
# match 5 < 4 with | true -> return 4 ;;
